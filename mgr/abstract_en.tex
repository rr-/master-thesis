The purpose of this paper is to present practical as well as theoretical modern
attacks on cryptographic hash functions. The author focuses on two functions:
\texttt{MD5} and \texttt{SHA-1}.

The paper is divided into four parts. The first one introduces reader to
cryptographic hash functions by presenting motivation behind them and  methods
of their construction.

The second part describes universal techniques that can be applied to attack
most cryptographic hash functions, regardless of their actual implementation.

The third part shows specialized attacks tailored to specific implementations
and comments on the severity of revealed weaknesses.

The last part presents methods of protection from both universal and
specialized attacks.
