The purpose of this paper is to present practical as well as theoretical modern
attacks on cryptographic hash functions. Author focuses on two functions:
\texttt{MD5} and \texttt{SHA-1}.

The paper is divided into four parts. First one introduces reader to
cryptographic hash functions by presenting motivation behind them and  methods
of their construction.

Second part describes universal techniques that can be applied to attack most
cryptographic hash functions, regardless of their actual implementation.

Third part shows specialized attacks tailored to specific implementations and
comments on the severity of revealed weaknesses.

The last part presents how to protect oneself from both universal and
specialized attacks.
